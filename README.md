## NJIT CS 675

Machine learning is a practice-driven course, here try to note down the assignments of the courses.

I will update the homework before or after the submission deadline.


### Homework 1

For part 2, explore dataset, please install the scikit-learn package before version 1.2, by using the command

```bash
pip install scikit_learn<1.2
```

or

```bash
conda install scikit_learn<1.2
```

you can explore the whole support version at https://scikit-learn.org/dev/versions.html

Then, make sure to select the correct python interpreter not matter in Colab or in local environment.
